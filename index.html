            <p>I've been working with HTML and CSS for 15 years or so, so I didn't do a second of the prep work involving the HTML course on CodeCademy. I've only been digging into the Git stuff, because it's far more interesting and useful for me. The only downside is that now I'm expected to use a handful of HTML5 tags I haven't seen before. Shot myself in the foot with a rubber band gun there, but markup is simple as hell, so no biggie. :)</p>

                <h2>Memory Lane</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I've had <a target="_blank" href="http://arthurpope.com">arthurpope.com</a> since sometime in the early 200's, and have had a few different versions of the site over the years.</p><p>Currently, it is maint a list of songs I have written, with as many recordings and videos as I still have from over the years. I haven't updated the site in probably three years, so there is a lot I need to change on it, including my <a target="_blank" href="http://arthurpope/com/resume">resume page</a>, which doesn't even have my current address on it. I'll be sure to get that changed before this Trivia Night, in case I sniff out any job prospects while there.</p>
            <p>The site is incredibly simple visually, which is intentional, because I am very aware of my ineptitude at graphic design. I'll stick with function over form as heavily as I can for the most part. The exception to that would be my employer's website which I created and maintain. But I'm using Squarespace, so <a target="_blank" href="https://mrcrecycling.net">this doesn't count for much, even though it looks decent</a>.</p>
            <p>Anywhoo, here are some snapshots of my website from past years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071102130054/http://arthurpope.com:80/">November 02, 2007</a> -This is as far back as I've got on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, Check out those sick W3C validation badges at the bottom, bruh! Too bad the Wayback machine didn't grab my stylesheet from back then. I'd like to see what this crap looked like.</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517003119/http://arthurpope.com/">May 17, 2014</a> -There were some versions bwtween these two, but I was using Squarespace, so again, it doesn't count. Here, you will find evidence of the eBay search tool that I created years ago, that I am still trying to rebuild using eBay's APIs, rather than just bodging together unreliable HTTP requests with JavaScript (Which I didn't actually know I was doing at the time. I just figured out how to make the tool work by noticing how the URL changed in my browser when I did a search, and changed filters for searches on eBay. I figured I could probably construct those URLs myself, and just... go to that URL. So I learned just enough JavaScript to code it up one Friday night while drinking. It worked for months. My coworkers used the site daily. Then it didn't anymore. I still don't know why it stopped working.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I expected to have more snapshots for this. I guess I didn't need to put that in a list. And my bullets have paragraphs in them. I know that looks dumb. I don't care right now.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Simply stated - Art makes my job easier. His technical expertise is of the highest caliber. Someone like myself, who lacks a technical background has to rely heavily on the tech/systems manager for changes in website layout, general technical questions, and advice on a regular basis. Art's communication style is exceptional as he is able to explain in terms that those without technical experience (me) can understand. Approachable, amiable, and knowledgeable - Art is a true asset to MRC recycling"</blockquote>

INTJs know what they know, and perhaps still more importantly, they know what they don't know."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote cite="http://typelogic.com/intj.html">"INTJs are perfectionists, with a seemingly endless capacity for improving upon anything that takes their interest. What prevents them from becoming chronically bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is the pragmatism so characteristic of the type: INTJs apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion "Does it work?" to everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms. This in turn produces an unusual independence of mind, freeing the INTJ from the constraints of authority, convention, or sentiment for its own sake."</blockquote>

                <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
                <p>Here's a fun story: For my work, we used to write eBay ads in spreadsheets so that I could enforce validation rules, and we ran into an issue where certain characters got al mangled up during the spreadsheet import into our listing program SixBit (previously Blackthorne). This usually happened when people tried copy/pasting things from the internet into their listings, or even when the spreadsheet converted things like fractions into actual fraction symbols. I solved the issue by converting these symbols to their corresponding entity codes automatically with some replace functions in the backend import conversion spreadsheet I built. Here is a list of the affected symbols we ran into most often:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&copy;</li>
                    <li>&Omega;</li>
